The statemachines example in package statemachine.* consists of a simulated 
development sequence of 3 statemachines. The development sequence is indicated 
by the package names: statemachine.year1 corresponds to a first version of all 
three statemachines, statemachine.year2 corresponds to the next iteration, and 
statemachine.year3 corresponds to the last iteration. 

In all three iterations, statemachines for a microwave oven, a cooking hood, 
and a CD player are developed. This directory contains diagram sketches of 
these statemachines, which have the same functionality across all three years.
The cooking hood and CD player use extended state (an integer variable).

The sequence of iterations is as follows:
year1: standard object-oriented state machine, one class per state, a single
       dispatching method for handling events
year2: refactoring into a generic state machine library (similar to Fowler), 
       more compact code and more reuse
year3: internal DSL (aka fluent interface) for building state machines using 
       the generic framework

Where possible, functionality from previous iterations is reused directly (so
use eclipse to navigate to classes that you cannot immediately see, they can
be found in one of the packages corresponding to previous iterations).
